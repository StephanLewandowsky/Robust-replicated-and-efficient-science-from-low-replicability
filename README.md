# Robust, replicated, and efficient science from low replicability

by Lewandowsky & Oberauer, _Nature Communications_. 

All simulation code and raw simulation output is in this repository. The dependency report explains the relationship between the various MATLAB source files. There are three standalone MATLAB programs: 

* mainRepMarket.m --- run this to recreate a simulation from scratch. Parameters are set in the first 30-40 lines of code (documented there).

* mainDrawRepFigures.m, mainDrawTheoryRepFigures.m, combineFigures.m --- scripts that create the figures for the paper from the output that's generated by mainRepMarket.m.
